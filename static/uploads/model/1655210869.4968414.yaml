    # Acoustic representation
    acoustic_features: spectrogram   # e.g one or multiple [MFCC, log-mel energies, spectrogram, CQT, PCEN, ...]

    # Data augmentation methods
    data_augmentation: time stretching            # [time stretching, block mixing, pitch shifting, ...]

    # Machine learning
    # In case using ensemble methods, please specify all methods used (comma separated list).
    machine_learning_method: template matching         # e.g one or multiple [GMM, HMM, SVM, kNN, MLP, CNN, RNN, CRNN, NMF, random forest, ensemble, transformer, ...]

    # External data usage method
    # e.g. directly, embeddings, pre-trained model, ...
    external_data_usage: directly

    # Post-processing, followed by the time span (in ms) in case of smoothing
    post_processing: [peak picking, threshold]    # [median filtering, time aggregation...]  
    
    # Classification level

  # System complexity, meta data provided here will be used to evaluate
  # submitted systems from the computational load perspective.
  complexity:

    # Total amount of parameters used in the acoustic model. For neural networks, this
    # information is usually given before training process in the network summary.
    # For other than neural networks, if parameter count information is not directly available,
    # try estimating the count as accurately as possible.
    # In case of ensemble approaches, add up parameters for all subsystems.
    total_parameters: variable    # note that for simple template matching, the "parameters"==the pixel count of the templates, plus 1 for each param such as thresholding. 
    # Approximate training time followed by the hardware used
